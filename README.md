## About

This repository contains the code, data, and results for the project titled "Multiomics Analysis of Human Pregnancy: Integrating Immunome, Transcriptome, Microbiome, Proteome, and Metabolome Data" conducted by Ourahou Mohamed. 

Pregnancy is a complex physiological process regulated by multiple interconnected biological systems. This project aims to understand the intricate biological processes underlying pregnancy by conducting a comprehensive multiomics analysis. It involves the integration of data from the immunome, transcriptome, microbiome, proteome, and metabolome to investigate the precise timing and coordination of adaptations during pregnancy and their potential implications for complications such as preterm birth and preeclampsia. 

For more details, please refer to the paper in this repository (paper.pdf).

## Data

- The project utilized data from 17 pregnant women who successfully delivered at full term, resulting in a total of 68 samples.
- Datasets from various biological domains, including the immunome, transcriptome, microbiome, proteome, and metabolome, were collected and analyzed.

---

## Methods

- Six distinct predictive models (Elastic Net, XGBoost Regressor, GradientBoosting Regressor, Support Vector Regressor, Huber Regressor, and AdaBoost Regressor) were employed to predict gestational age using the different datasets.
- A stacked generalization approach was used to integrate the diverse datasets into a unified model.

---

## Results

- The amalgamation of multiomics datasets significantly improved the accuracy of gestational age prediction.
- Intriguing novel interactions between different biological modalities were discovered.
- The findings provide valuable insights into the complex biological processes of pregnancy and potential avenues for preventing and managing pregnancy-related complications.
